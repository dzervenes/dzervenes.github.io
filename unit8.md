# Gradient Cost Function

---

In this task, I explored the gradient descent loss function by adjusting the learning rate and iteration count to minimise cost. I learned that fine-tuning these parameters significantly impacts optimisation efficiency. A learning rate of 0.08 and 160 iterations achieved the lowest cost, reinforcing the importance of balanced parameter selection in machine learning.
