# The Future of Machine Learning

---

In this activity, I investigated the application of predictive machine learning models in Industry 4.0, focusing on their role in railway maintenance. I analysed methods like Stochastic Bayesian Models and rule-based fuzzy semantic inference, exploring their impact on asset reliability and maintenance optimisation. Additionally, I examined Digital Twins technology, emphasising its ability to enhance predictive capabilities. This work highlighted the importance of data-driven solutions for efficient and reliable railway operations.
