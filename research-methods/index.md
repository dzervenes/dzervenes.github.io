## About me

Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Martyna, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and a Swiss railway conductor. Beyond my academic and professional life, I have a passion for bachata and belly dancing, playing the trumpet, learning foreign languages, and spending time with my lovely dogs.

I am always keen to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful ventures. Feel free to connect with me to share ideas or discuss opportunities!

## Research Methods and Professional Practice

This e-portfolio showcases my academic progress during the University of Essex Online Research Methods and Professional Practice module, April 2025. Covering topics from research design and literature review to hypothesis testing, ethics, and professional development, it reflects the key skills and critical reflections I have developed. It presents a cohesive narrative of how Iâ€™ve applied research principles and statistical techniques in both academic and real-world contexts, while preparing for independent research and long-term professional growth.
