# Case Study on Privacy

---

In this activity, I reflected on a case involving a public records clerk asked to disclose personal data to a researcher. I analysed the ethical duties of both parties, focusing on consent, data minimisation, and lawful processing, as outlined in the UK GDPR (UK Government, 2016). I also considered the principle of informed consent, which is essential to ethical research practice (Beauchamp and Childress, 2013). This task helped reinforce my understanding of privacy, confidentiality, and legal obligations in research involving personal data.
