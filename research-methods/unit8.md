# E-Portfolio Activity: Research Proposal Outline
---

IThis formative activity involved drafting a research proposal outline focused on interpretable and reliable machine learning for epidemic forecasting. I defined the research problem, formulated a central question, and proposed a hybrid MLâ€“epidemiological model integrating interpretability tools such as SHAP and LIME. The outline also addressed methodological planning, ethical considerations, and the development of a prototype forecasting tool. This submission helped clarify the research direction and guided the design of my final proposal.
