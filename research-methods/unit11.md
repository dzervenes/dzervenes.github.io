# Professional Skills Reflection and Development Plan

---

This task involved reviewing the Professional Skills Matrix, conducting a personal SWOT analysis, and creating an action plan. I reflected on how the Research Methods module supported my development in research design, ethics, quantitative analysis, and critical engagement with literature—key areas outlined in the BCS guidelines and Essex graduate attributes (BCS, 2022; Wong et al., 2021). I linked these skills to academic and workplace contexts, such as analysing railway failure data. Using reflective models (e.g. Gibbs, 1988), I identified specific areas for growth and created a detailed plan to gain experience in primary research, enhance data analysis, and improve visualisation skills using R.
