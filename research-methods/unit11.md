# Professional Skills Reflection and Development Plan

---

This task involved reviewing the Professional Skills Matrix, conducting a personal SWOT analysis, and creating an action plan. I reflected on how the Research Methods module supported my development in research design, ethics, quantitative analysis, and critical engagement with literatureâ€”key areas outlined in the BCS guidelines and Essex graduate attributes (BCS, 2022; University of Essex, 2023). I linked these skills to academic and workplace contexts, such as analysing railway failure data. Using reflective models (e.g. Gibbs, 1988), I identified specific areas for growth and created a detailed plan to gain experience in primary research, enhance data analysis, and improve visualisation skills using R.
