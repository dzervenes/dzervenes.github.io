# Collaborative Discussion 2 - Case Study: Accuracy of information

---

This three-week discussion focused on the ethical and legal challenges faced by Abi, a programmer whose data analysis contradicted a client's claims about a new cereal. I examined Abiâ€™s responsibility to report all findings transparently, referencing the ACM and BCS codes of conduct (ACM, 2018; BCS, 2022). I explored how selective reporting, even without falsifying data, can mislead the public and potentially violate laws like the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations (UK Government, 2008). This activity deepened my understanding of ethical integrity and accountability in data reporting.
