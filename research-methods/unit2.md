# Collaborative Discussion 1: Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct

---

This three-week discussion explored ethical responsibilities in computing. I chose the Coraz√≥n case study (ACM, 2018b), which examines data security in healthcare technology. I evaluated it using the ACM Code of Ethics and the BCS Code of Conduct (ACM, 2018; BCS, 2021), focusing on public interest, legal compliance, and professional accountability. Engaging with peers expanded my understanding of how ethical frameworks apply in practice and reinforced the need for anticipatory thinking in emerging technologies.
