# Wiki Activity : Clustering

K-Means clustering is a method used to group similar data points into clusters. It works by dividing data into a set number of groups, called K, where each group has similar characteristics.  As an unsupervised learning algorithm, it identifies patterns in data without requiring predefined labels or categories, making it useful for exploring unknown data structures (Sinaga and Yang, 2020).
