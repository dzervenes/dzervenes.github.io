# K-means Clustering

In this activity, I used K-Means clustering on three datasets: Iris, Wine, and WeatherAUS. I prepared and normalised the data, used the elbow method to find the best number of clusters, and evaluated the results with Adjusted Rand Index and Homogeneity Score. PCA helped visualise the clusters, showing clear groupings for Iris and Wine. For WeatherAUS, I identified patterns like cooler, warmer, or windy weather. I learned how to prepare data and evaluate clustering for better insights.
