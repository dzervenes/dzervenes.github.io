I analysed the Auto-MPG dataset, which contains 398 entries across 9 features, including fuel efficiency, engine specifications, and car origins. Invalid entries in the horsepower column were addressed by converting it to numeric format and filling gaps with the median, ensuring consistency.

Visualisations revealed that fuel efficiency negatively correlates with weight, displacement, and horsepower, while positively correlating with model year and region. Newer, lighter, and less powerful cars, particularly from specific regions, were found to be more fuel-efficient. A heatmap confirmed strong inter-correlations among engine size, power, and weight, highlighting their combined influence on efficiency.

Additionally, origin values were mapped to regions, enabling deeper insights into regional trends. This analysis underscores the factors influencing fuel efficiency and prepares the dataset for further predictive modelling.
