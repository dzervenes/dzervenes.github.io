# Jaccard Coefficient

In this activity, I calculated similarity scores to analyse health attribute overlaps among three individuals. I created a dataset, defined pairs for comparison, and visualised the results using a heatmap. By excluding gender, I refined the scores, focusing purely on health-related attributes. This activity enhanced my understanding of pairwise comparisons, the impact of specific features, and the importance of unbiased analysis in evaluating similarities.
