## About me

Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Martyna, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and a Swiss railway conductor. Beyond my academic and professional life, I have a passion for bachata and belly dancing, playing the trumpet, learning foreign languages, and spending time with my lovely dogs.

I am always keen to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful ventures. Feel free to connect with me to share ideas or discuss opportunities!

## Research Methods and Professional Practice

This e-portfolio is thoughtfully curated to showcase my academic progress during the University of Essex Onlineâ€™s Machine Learning module, November 2024. Covering diverse topics, from Exploratory Data Analysis to Neural Networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks, it highlights the key concepts, skills, and reflections I have developed throughout the course. This portfolio presents a cohesive narrative of my learning journey, demonstrating how I have applied theoretical knowledge to practical tasks while showcasing my growth in the dynamic field of machine learning.
