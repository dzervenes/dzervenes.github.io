# Collaborative Discussion 2: Legal and Ethical views on ANN applications

---

In this activity, I wrote an initial and summary post to discuss the transformative potential and risks of AI writers, drawing insights from Hutson (2021). I examined their applications in healthcare and marketing while addressing ethical challenges like bias and privacy concerns. Additionally, I responded to discussions initiated by my peers, exploring issues such as skill erosion and transparency. These interactions deepened my understanding of the importance of ethical AI practices, human oversight, and balanced adoption to ensure AI tools are implemented responsibly across various industries.
