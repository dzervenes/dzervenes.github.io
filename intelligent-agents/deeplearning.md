# Deep Learning in Action

---

In this exercise, I was asked to research a deep learning application that could significantly impact society, either positively or negatively. I chose deep learning in medical imaging diagnostics. I explored how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and related architectures interpret X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to support disease detection and clinical decision-making. My post discussed the technologyâ€™s benefits, including improved accuracy and accessibility, as well as socio-technical and ethical challenges such as privacy, bias, explainability, and workforce implications. This activity demonstrated how deep learning integrates innovation with responsibility in sensitive, human-centred domains like healthcare.
