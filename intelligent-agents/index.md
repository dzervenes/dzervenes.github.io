## About me

Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Martyna, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and a Swiss railway conductor. Beyond my academic and professional life, I have a passion for bachata and belly dancing, playing the trumpet, learning foreign languages, and spending time with my lovely dogs.

I am always keen to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful ventures. Feel free to connect with me to share ideas or discuss opportunities!

## Intelligent Agents

This e-Portfolio showcases my academic progress during the University of Essex Online Intelligent Agents module, July 2025. It presents key discussions, research, and practical exercises that explore Agent-Based Systems (ABS), Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), and ethical issues in intelligent system design. Through developing KQML and KIF agent dialogues, I demonstrated my understanding of how autonomous agents collaborate and adapt, reflecting my growth in applying AI principles to real-world contexts.
