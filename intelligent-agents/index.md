## About me

Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Martyna, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and a Swiss railway conductor. Beyond my academic and professional life, I have a passion for bachata and belly dancing, playing the trumpet, learning foreign languages, and spending time with my lovely dogs.

I am always keen to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful ventures. Feel free to connect with me to share ideas or discuss opportunities!
