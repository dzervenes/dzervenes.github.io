## About me

Welcome to my e-portfolio! I am Martyna, a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence and a Swiss railway conductor. Beyond my academic and professional life, I have a passion for bachata and belly dancing, playing the trumpet, learning foreign languages, and spending time with my lovely dogs.

I am always keen to learn, collaborate, and contribute to meaningful ventures. Feel free to connect with me to share ideas or discuss opportunities!

## Intelligent Agents

This e-Portfolio has been carefully curated to showcase my academic progress during the University of Essex Online Intelligent Agents module, July 2025. Throughout this module, I explored the foundations and applications of agent-based computing, including Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), Agent-Based Systems (ABS), and ethical considerations in intelligent system design. The portfolio highlights key discussions, research activities, and practical exercises such as developing KQML and KIF agent dialogues that demonstrate my understanding of how autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and solve complex real-world problems. Collectively, these works reflect my growth in applying artificial intelligence principles to dynamic, distributed, and adaptive systems.
