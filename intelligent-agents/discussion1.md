# Collaborative Discussion 1 Agent Based Systems

---

In this exercise, I was asked to discuss the factors behind the rise of agent-based systems (ABS) and the benefits they provide to organisations. I explained that ABS have grown in importance due to their ability to model and manage complex, dynamic environments that traditional systems cannot easily handle (Macal and North, 2010). I explored how they are applied in simulation and real-time operations, such as smart manufacturing (Leitão et al., 2016), and how emergence helps reveal collective behaviours that support better decision-making (Davidsson, Persson and Holmgren, 2007). Overall, I concluded that ABS offer flexibility, resilience, and scalability for modern organisations.
