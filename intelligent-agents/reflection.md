# Individual Reflection

---

In this reflective piece, I evaluated my learning journey throughout the Intelligent Agents module, considering both my technical progress and personal development. I discussed how my understanding of agent-based systems, communication languages, and ethical implications in AI evolved through research, collaboration, and practical exercises. I reflected on challenges such as designing KQML-based dialogues and balancing autonomy with accountability in multi-agent environments. The reflection also highlighted how teamwork, critical analysis, and problem-solving strengthened my confidence in applying intelligent system concepts to real-world contexts, reinforcing the connection between theoretical study and professional practice in artificial intelligence.
