# Creating Agent Dialogues

---

In this exercise, I was asked to create an agent dialogue using KQML (Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language) and KIF (Knowledge Interchange Format) between two agents: Alice, a procurement agent, and Bob, a warehouse agent. The goal was for Alice to query Bob about the available stock of 50-inch televisions and the number of HDMI slots they have. I designed and implemented this dialogue in Python, simulating realistic KQML messages containing KIF content. The program demonstrates how autonomous agents can exchange structured knowledge and responses in a standardised communication framework, supporting interoperability and intelligent coordination between systems.
