# Collaborative Discussion 3 Deep Learning

---

In this exercise, I was asked to consider the ethical issues surrounding new deep learning technologies such as DALLÂ·E and ChatGPT, which can automatically generate text and images. I explored how these systems raise important ethical concerns including environmental sustainability, accountability, transparency, and over-reliance on automation. My response discussed the carbon footprint of model training, the difficulty of tracing responsibility for AI outputs, and the risks of eroding human creativity and judgement. I concluded that ethical deep learning requires technical safeguards, transparent governance, and public dialogue to ensure that innovation aligns with human values and societal well-being.
