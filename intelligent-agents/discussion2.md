# Collaborative Discussion 2 Agent Communication Languages

---


In this exercise, I was asked to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Agent Communication Languages (ACLs) such as KQML and to compare them with method invocation in languages like Python or Java. I explained that ACLs enable richer, intention-based communication between autonomous agents, supporting flexibility and negotiation in distributed environments (Finin et al., 1994). I contrasted this with method invocation, which is faster but more rigid. I also explored how emerging research, including interoperability protocols and reinforcement learning, extends ACL principles for modern multi-agent systems, highlighting the ongoing trade-off between efficiency, expressiveness, and system autonomy.
