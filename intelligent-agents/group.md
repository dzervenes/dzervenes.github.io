# Development Individual Project Presentation

---

In this assignment, my team and I acted as software consultants specialising in agent design and development. We were tasked with producing a comprehensive design proposal for a domain-specific intelligent agent system. Our chosen domain was academic research online, where the agent retrieves, processes, and stores information from web sources. The report outlined system requirements, design decisions, UML diagrams, and a rationale supported by academic literature. Through collaboration and regular progress meetings, we developed a structured, business-ready proposal demonstrating our understanding of multi-agent system design, autonomous behaviour modelling, and the application of AI principles to real-world problem solving.
