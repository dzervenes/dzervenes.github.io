# Correlation and Regression

In this activity, I explored various regression techniques, including linear, multiple linear, and polynomial regression, using datasets such as cars.csv. Key experiments included analysing covariance, correlation, and how changes in data characteristics (variance, noise, sample size, outliers) influence regression models. I calculated predictions for CO2 emissions based on weight and volume, evaluated the impact of polynomial degrees, and observed how outliers skew results.

This task enhanced my understanding of statistical relationships, model sensitivity to data changes, and the importance of data preprocessing. I learned how to evaluate model fit through metrics like Pearson's correlation and RÂ² values for robust predictions.
