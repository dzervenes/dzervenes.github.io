# CNN Model Activity

In this activity, I explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object recognition, evaluating a model's predictions and analysing its accuracy. While the model successfully classified objects such as "ship" and "frog," it also misclassified others, like "dog," revealing opportunities for improvement. 

Additionally, I reflected on the ethical implications of CNNs, particularly in facial recognition technology, drawing on Matthew Wallâ€™s (2019) article. This included examining biases, accuracy challenges, and societal impacts, such as misidentifications and privacy concerns, underscoring the importance of ethical development and robust safeguards.
